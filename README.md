# RevealJS Template

A bare (little opinionated) RevealJS template customized for markdown slides.

Please refer [RevealJS Docs](https://revealjs.com/config/) for further customization.

## How to?

Just clone this repo and start editing `slides.md` file. Some high level settings like title etc. can be modified in `index.html`.

When you're ready, open the `index.html` file in the browser or use a http server for all features. For e.g. if you have python installed, you can just run `python -m http.server` in the director where you have the files.

Go make awesome presentations!
